# Why Go? - DRAFT WORK IN PROGRESS

Imagine that you're on your first step into coding, this would be the first question to pop in your head, why should I learn Go? why not any other language? Ruby? C++? Java?

The answer is simple, because Go is awesome! but why? Well.. this is what you'll learn through the workshop. (I found this answer quite catchy)

At this point, I'd share a personal story, something like:
- what my background is.
- how I got into coding.
- how my journey with Go started.

Now that people warmed up to the idea, we can actually start introducing what's in the store.

## Oh the fancy words!

## Real-life project example

## Community

## A teaser

## What's Go popularity in the industry

## Companies using Go

You can find list of companies using Go [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/GoUsers).
Why is it good to mention the many companies who has chosen the way of Go?
- established companies thinks that it's a good investment for the future.
- they believe in the technology.
- the popularity of the language.
- more job opportunities.
- this is not a toy language & I am not wasting my time (not everyone is doing this for a hobby, most participants are serious job seeker / people trying to have a career change).

At the end of name dropping would be the perfect opportunity to say:

> This is the perfect time to learn Go!
