# WWGLondon & GoBridge workshop: Learn to code with Go!

This repository is forked from Natalie P's Go for complete beginners course -> https://github.com/Pisush/go_for_complete_beginners, originally written as a part of GoBridge's training modules for beginners level. WWGLondon run the workshop together with GoBridge on January - February 2017. This is our version of the workshop, which was tailored to fit in three Saturdays instead of six meetings.

## Go for Complete Beginners

This workshop is designed to teach complete beginners (people with no coding experience) programming principles using Go.
It is planned for 6 meetings of 3 hours each, including a short break, based on the workshop that was held in Berlin on 09-11/2016. We met every other week, and in-between the instructors were available on the Gophers slack to answer questions.
The content is an adjustment of How I Start to be complete-beginner friendly, with the kind permission of Peter Bourgon.
See course outline for detailed TOC.

### How to read this guide

Most weeks have a theoretical part and a practical part
The theoretical part should be discussed in a group, and the instructor can show an example. Each bullet point and sub-point should be mentioned and clarified.
The practical part can take place in the playground or locally, depends on the week. Each bullet point and sub-point should have an exercise or two done by each participant. As those are mostly basic elements of the language, the instructor is encouraged to think of local version. For example, practice the fmt library to print a sentence relevant to the recent news.
The homework part are exercises the participants will do at home between the meetings to repeat the material and can ask about on slack.

### Instructing tips

asking “is all clear?” or “who didn’t understand?” is not enough. Many participants are shy or afraid to ask a stupid question.
Some approaches that worked in the Berlin chapter:
Remind there are no stupid questions here
Thanking and responding that it was a good question
Speak slowly and repeat the keywords - both new and previous terms
Get the other instructors to walk in the class and ask each participant at least once during the meeting “what questions do you have?”
When a difficult technical question is asked in the group discussion, invite the person to discuss this during the break
