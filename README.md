# WWGLondon & GoBridge beginner's level workshop - DRAFT

<br/>
This repository is forked from **Natalie P's: Go for complete beginners** course:
 https://github.com/Pisush/go_for_complete_beginners

Originally, the course was written as a part of [GoBridge's training modules](https://github.com/gobridge/workshops) for beginners level. [WWGLondon](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Go-London/) together with [GoBridge](https://golangbridge.org/) ran a workshop called [Learn to code with Go!]() in January - February 2017. This is our version of the workshop, which was tailored to fit in three Saturdays instead of six meetings.

## Go for Complete Beginners: In a nutshell

- This workshop is designed to teach programming principles using Go.
- The targeted audience are people with no coding experience.
- The length of the workshop is ~18h, this can be broken to 3 classes of ~6h each.
- Our typical class runs from 10am until 5pm on a Saturday, including a lunch break and a couple of short coffee breaks.
- In between classes, the instructors are to be available on the Gophers slack to answer questions.
- This workshop is loosely based on the workshop that was held by [Women Techmaker Berlin](https://www.meetup.com/gdgberlin/events/233883713/) on 2016.
- The content of the course outline is an adjustment of [How I Start](https://howistart.org/posts/go/1) to be complete-beginner friendly, with the kind permission of [Peter Bourgon](https://peter.bourgon.org/) (as mentioned on the original repository).

### How to read this guide

- Most weeks have a theoretical part and a practical part.
- The theoretical part should be discussed in a group and the instructor can show an example.
  - Each bullet point and sub-point should be mentioned and clarified.
- The practical part can take place in the playground or locally, depends on the week.
  - Each bullet point and sub-point should have an exercise or two done by each participant.
  - As those are mostly basic elements of the language, the instructor is encouraged to think of local version. _e.g.:_ practice the `fmt` library to print a sentence relevant to the recent news.
- The homework part are exercises the participants will do at home between the meetings to repeat the material and can ask about on slack.

### Instructing tips

- Asking “is all clear?” or “who didn’t understand?” is not enough. Many participants are shy or afraid to ask a stupid question.
- Some approaches that worked in the Berlin chapter:
  - Remind participants that there are such thing as stupid questions.
  - Thanking and responding that it was a good question.
  - Speak slowly and repeat the keywords (both new and previous terms).
  - Get the other instructors to walk in the class and ask each participant at least once during the meeting “what questions do you have?”
- When a difficult technical question is asked in the group discussion, invite the person to discuss this during the break.
